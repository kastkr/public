As an aspiring brewer I believe the best place to open a brewery is **A)** a location that is part of a tight cluster of oth[](http://)er breweries **B)** of the clusters - the best cluster is the one that has the most food/dining options in close proximity.  The goal is to leverage a data driven approach for identifying the appropriate geographic clusters, ranking them based on proximity/magnitude of food/dining options, and then presenting the output in an easily consumable map."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Data**\n\nThe data for this exercise is going to be captured leveraging the Foursquare API.  Specifically we will be leveraging the **search** endpoint to first find all breweries within the Seattle area.  After this we will then be clustering these breweries based on geography.  Finally we will be using the centerpoints of these clusters to then once again leverage the **search** endpoint to identify the cluster with the greatest preponderance of food/dining options in close proximity."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Methodology** \n\nSection which represents the main component of the report where you discuss and describe any exploratory data analysis that you did, any inferential statistical testing that you performed, if any, and what machine learnings were used and why."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nfrom geopy.geocoders import Nominatim # convert an address into latitude and longitude values\nimport folium","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"CLIENT_ID = 'THIIRDS3XMAMXQHJMABQD0FY3SGAU2VOKO5L5GHZUIMJXP4L' # your Foursquare ID\nCLIENT_SECRET = 'KI02NYNZGDL4X11ABARV21OHSJNTF4NEMGZCJWEUXZM3CAHL' # your Foursquare Secret\nVERSION = '20180605' # Foursquare API version","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"address = 'Seattle, WA'\n\ngeolocator = Nominatim(user_agent=\"sea_explorer\")\nlocation = geolocator.geocode(address)\nlatitude = location.latitude\nlongitude = location.longitude\nprint('The geograpical coordinate of Seattle are {}, {}.'.format(latitude, longitude))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# create map of Seattle using latitude and longitude values\nmap_seattle = folium.Map(location=[latitude, longitude], zoom_start=11.5)\nmap_seattle","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Results**\n\nSection where you discuss the results."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Discussion**\n\nSection where you discuss any observations you noted and any recommendations you can make based on the results."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Conclusion**\n\nSection where you conclude the report."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
